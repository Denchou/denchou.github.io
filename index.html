    <h3 class="text-center">The Zen of Den</h3>
    <p>Hello! Welcome to my website. My name is Den. It is not short for anything, nor was I named after anybody. I was named after a mountain close to where I was born. The place where I was born is not important, because it no longer exists, but
      you
      can learn more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khao-I-Dang" target="_blank" title="Cambodian Refugee Camp">here.</a>
      Additional information about my history can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge_Killing_Fields" target="_blank" title='If only I can use this link for all the times people have asked me, "...no offense, but, what are you?"'>here</a>.</p>
    <p>I can probably mention a lot of interesting things about my life, like how I only became fluent in English in my early 20s, my stint as an ordained Buddhist monk, my surprised baptism, my love and hate
      relationship with dairy, my propensity to name my cats after dead Presidents, or my amazing collections of umbrellas, but I'm sure you are here because you showed interest in me, and for that, I thank you. </p>
    <p>So enough about <em>Past</em> me, let's get to know <em>Present</em> and <em>Future</em> me! First and foremost, I see the world differently than your average human. I am irreverant, whimsical and my humor is dry. In my opinion, it's much
      better than being seriously boring with a wet sense of humor. My definition of success is having enough to eat and avoid being eaten. Not a lot of room for ambitions because...<blockquote class="text-center">"Ambition is the last refuge of the
        failure. - Oscar Wilde"</blockquote>
      Outside of that, I believe life is meant
      to be an experience. I love experiencing new things, exploring new places, both abstract and concrete. That thing you wished you had done or experience could disappear at any given time. I read somewhere that Venice was sinking. Can you
      imagine never having done Venetian things before Venice sinks? That would be SAD, and SAD backwards is DAS and DAS not good. It would be naive to believe that things last forever, however, the mere act of experiencing things before they fade
      away gives me a sense of joy and accomplishment - PASCAL for example. According to the Zen masters of Japan, there is a gentle happiness in accepting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_no_aware" target="_blank" title="Very Zen Link!">Awareness of Things</a>.</p>
    <p>I have shown my ability to grow, adjust, adapt, and survive just by simply existing. To use video games as an anology, I started in Hard Mode and I haven't died yet. I will not try to sell you on my abilities - my work and project history
      will speak for themselves. But I will try to give you a reason to invest in someone like me. I have learned early in life that I can never be the best at something. This is a fact that I have accepted in all aspects of life. Here is a factual
      sentence: I am not the best web developer in the world. Here is the key fact in that sentence: I am a web developer. If you need a web developer, I highly recommend you invest in me. If I am capable of developing skills to build a full-stack
      application in 3 months, imagine the possibilities if I were given the opportunity to do more.</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 5px;" class="proj cell auto">Tic-Tac-Toe was my first ever attempt at creating a Single-Page application(SPA). The goal was to
          create a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game as an SPA using authentication. The frontend was built using Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap 3,
          HTML5, and CSS3. Coming from a Computer Science background, creating the logic for Tic-Tac-Toe was the easier part.
          <br><br>It took me awhile to wrap my head around manipulating the DOM using JQuery. Whenever a problem took too long,
          I resort to googling for solutions -- most of the time it was merely a syntax issue. I had a lot of fun adding in additional features and easter eggs in the end.

        <p style="margin-left: 5px;" class="proj cell auto">I had the idea of creating Your Opinion as a web app after enjoying some hilarious
          memes where people post photos of reviews on just about anything you can imagine. So I decided, why not make an app for that?
          This was my first SPA where I had to build the front-end along with the back-end. I
          used Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap 4, Handlebars, HTML5 and SASS for my front-end. The back-end API was built with Ruby on Rails using Active Record
          and PSQL.
          <br><br>I spent roughly two weeks learning Ruby and Rails. Once it was time to code, I hit the ground running creating all my resources in the back end. Even though
          this was my first app using Rails and I was amazed and how east, <em>and dangerous</em>, ActiveRecord could be. Most of my time was spent building the front end. I had just learned
          about a tool called Handlebars which helped resolve some Cross-Site Scripting woes.

        <p style="margin-left: 5px;" class="proj cell auto">
          The Bag of Holding was my very first project working in a team setting. Our objective was to create
          a web app similar to DropBox, using Amazon AWS S3 service as an endpoint for user's file storage and uploads. It was the first web app where we used
          MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.js as the back-end. The front-end was built using Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery/AJAX, and SASS.
          <br><br>I learned a lot with this project. We started by researching the scrum team model assigning each other roles, with me being scrum lead. At first there were a few encounters with git merge conflicts but we were able
          to come together to resolve the issues. I enjoyed the group dynamic and was able to assist in all aspect of the project by being a floating coder where I jump
          in to assist with either front-end or back-end, whether it's to create the Handlebars or figure out MimeType, coding wherever neccessary to produce a Minimal Viable Product(MVP).

        </div>
      </div>
        <p style="margin-left: 5px;" class="proj cell auto">The Budget Calendar is my most ambitious project to date. It was built using new frameworks:
          React.js, JSX, Axios using Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord and PSQL for the back-end. Despite having worked with MongoDB and Express.js in prior
          projects, I thought the Ruby on Rails api had better documentation and the right relational database I need to craft a budget calendar.
          of great methods for date manipulation. Moment.js and fnDates were some of the few I read, I ended up turning to fnDates due to better documentation
          provided.
          <br><br>Thinking in React took awhile and though I am not fluent in it yet, I'd love to play with it more. I chose an app that reminded me of my
          old days as a Client Manager. A lot of my clients were asking us to build them a budget calendar for their students and our development team never
          had the time or resource to do it. Having completed the fully functional budget calendar when I had only 4 days to learn React and 4 days to create it
          gave me a euphoric feeling of accomplishment, even if it was after the fact, I was having a moment. Looking forward to many more moments to come.
