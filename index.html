    <h3 class="text-center">The Zen of Den</h3>
    <p>Hello! Welcome to my website. My name is Den. It is not short for anything, nor was I named after anybody. I was named after a mountain close to where I was born. The place where I was born is not important, because it no longer exists, but
      you
      can learn more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khao-I-Dang" target="_blank" title="Cambodian Refugee Camp">here.</a>
      Additional information about my history can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge_Killing_Fields" target="_blank" title='If only I can use this link for all the times people have asked me, "...no offense, but, what are you?"'>here</a>.</p>
    <p>I can probably mention a lot of interesting things about my life, like how I only became fluent in English in my early 20s, my stint as an ordained Buddhist monk, my surprised baptism, my love and hate
      relationship with dairy, my propensity to name my cats after dead Presidents, or my amazing collections of umbrellas, but I'm sure you are here because you showed interest in me, and for that, I thank you. </p>
    <p>So enough about <em>Past</em> me, let's get to know <em>Present</em> and <em>Future</em> me! First and foremost, I see the world differently than your average human. I am irreverant, whimsical and my humor is dry. In my opinion, it's much
      better than being seriously boring with a wet sense of humor. My definition of success is having enough to eat and avoid being eaten. Not a lot of room for ambitions because...<blockquote class="text-center">"Ambition is the last refuge of the
        failure. - Oscar Wilde"</blockquote>
      Outside of that, I believe life is meant
      to be an experience. I love experiencing new things, exploring new places, both abstract and concrete. That thing you wished you had done or experience could disappear at any given time. I read somewhere that Venice was sinking. Can you
      imagine never having done Venetian things before Venice sinks? That would be SAD, and SAD backwards is DAS and DAS not good. It would be naive to believe that things last forever, however, the mere act of experiencing things before they fade
      away gives me a sense of joy and accomplishment - PASCAL for example. According to the Zen masters of Japan, there is a gentle happiness in accepting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_no_aware" target="_blank" title="Very Zen Link!">Awareness of Things</a>.</p>
    <p>I have shown my ability to grow, adjust, adapt, and survive just by simply existing. To use video games as an anology, I started in Hard Mode and I haven't died yet. I will not try to sell you on my abilities - my work and project history
      will speak for themselves. But I will try to give you a reason to invest in someone like me. I have learned early in life that I can never be the best at something. This is a fact that I have accepted in all aspects of life. Here is a factual
      sentence: I am not the best web developer in the world. Here is the key fact in that sentence: I am a web developer. If you need a web developer, I highly recommend you invest in me. If I am capable of developing skills to build a full-stack
      application in 3 months, imagine the possibilities if I were given the opportunity to do more.</p>
